When email clicked, should produce what is seen on the right in the mockup
- Put link in subject content that redirects to the same page or another end point where right pane is rendered
- Or it changes the state of the right pane
- Can you put a link in the entire row?

Tasks:
- put link in subject
- have it fetch student info and render right pane when clicked  
- need to create display component of right pane (what will be rendered)

Layout:
- 1 row, 2 columns 
    - table in column 1
    - right pane in column 2
        - put place holder info
            - grey initially
- after you've put everything in, look into how to vary height with content

Questions?
- When should you be thinking of using a table versus a row and a column
